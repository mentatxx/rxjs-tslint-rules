`rxjs-tslint-rules` is small set of TSLint rules to:

* help manage projects that use `rxjs/add/...` imports;
* enforce or disallow [Finnish notation](https://medium.com/@benlesh/observables-and-finnish-notation-df8356ed1c9b); and
* highlight other potential problems (see the rules for details).

### Rules

The package includes the following rules (none of which are enabled by default):

| Rule | Description | Options |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rxjs-add` | Enforces the importation of patched observables and operators used in the module. | See below |
| `rxjs-finnish` | Enforces the use of [Finnish notation](https://medium.com/@benlesh/observables-and-finnish-notation-df8356ed1c9b). | None |
| `rxjs-no-add` | Disallows the importation of patched observables and operators. | See below |
| `rxjs-no-create` | Disallows the calling of `Observable.create`. Useful as a warning. | None |
| `rxjs-no-do` | I do without `do` operators. [Do you not?](https://youtu.be/spG-Yj0zEyc) Well, `do` isn't always a code smell, but this rule can be useful as a warning. | None |
| `rxjs-no-finnish` | Disallows the use of [Finnish notation](https://medium.com/@benlesh/observables-and-finnish-notation-df8356ed1c9b). | None |
| `rxjs-no-ignored-error` | Disallows the calling of `subscribe` without specifying a error handler. | None |
| `rxjs-no-operator` | Disallows importation from the `operator` directory. Useful if you prefer ['lettable' operators](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/master/doc/lettable-operators.md) - which are located in the `operators` directory. | None |
| `rxjs-no-patched` | Disallows the calling of patched methods. Methods must be imported and called explicitly - not via `Observable` or `Observable.prototype`. | See below |
| `rxjs-no-subject-unsubscribe` | Disallows the calling of `unsubscribe` directly upon `Subject` instances. For an explanation of why this can be a problem, see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45112125/6680611) Stack Overflow answer. | None |
| `rxjs-no-unused-add` | Disallows the importation of patched observables or operators that are not used in the module. | None |
| `rxjs-no-wholesale` | Disallows the wholesale importation of `rxjs` or `rxjs/Rx`. | None |

### Options

#### `rxjs-add`

The `rxjs-add` rule takes an optional object with the property `file`. This is the path of the module - relative to the `tsconfig.json` - that imports the patched observables and operators.

For example:

```json
"rules": {
  "rxjs-add": {
    "options": [{
      "allowElsewhere": false,
      "allowUnused": false,
      "file": "./source/rxjs-imports.ts"
    }],
    "severity": "error"
  }
}
```

Specifying the `file` option allows all of the patched observables and operators to be kept in a central location. Said module should be imported before other modules that use patched observables and operators. The importation of said module is not enforced; the rule only ensures that it imports observables and operators that are used in other modules.

If `file` is specified, the `allowElsewhere` and `allowUnused` options can be used to configure whether or not patched imports are allowed in other files and whether or not unused patched imports are allowed. Both `allowElsewhere` and `allowUnused` default to `false`.

Note that there is no `file` option for the `rxjs-no-unused-add` rule, so that rule should not be used in conjunction with the `rxjs-add` rule - if the `file` option is specified for the latter. Use the `rxjs-add` rule's `allowUnused` option instead.

If the `file` option is not specified, patched observables and operators must be imported in the modules in which they are used.

#### `rxjs-no-add` and `rxjs-no-patched`

The `rxjs-no-add` and `rxjs-no-patched` rules take an optional object with the optional properties `allowObservables` and `allowOperators`. The properties can be specified as booleans - to allow or disallow all observables or operators - or as arrays of strings - to allow or disallow a subset of observables or operators.

For example:

```json
"rules": {
  "rxjs-no-patched": {
    "options": [{
      "allowObservables": ["never", "throw"],
      "allowOperators": false
    }],
    "severity": "error"
  }
}
```
